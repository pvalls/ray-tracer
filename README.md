# A Ray-Tracer Engine in *c++*

## Introduction

This is the final project for the Subject *Synthetic Image* (Ray Tracing for Realistic Image Synthesis) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona).](https://www.upf.edu)

Following the course me and my partner partially implemented a Ray-Tracer Graphics Engine in c++.

More specifically, we implemented:

- An *intersection shader*, a *depth shader*, a *direct illumination shader*, and a *global illumination shader* that takes into account indirect illumination (n bounces indirect illumination). 

- Different *phong materials* with solid, mirror-like, transmissive and many other behaviours.

- Light sources which have an area (as opposed to thepoint light sources)

- New geometric figures such as spheres, infinite planes cilinders and Disks using rayobject intersection mathematics.

## Environment Setup

To run the code we recommend to open the project file using Microsoft Visual Studio.

Otherwise, you can take the raw code and run it yourself on any other platform.
